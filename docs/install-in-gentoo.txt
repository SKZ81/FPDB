These instructions are for Gentoo GNU/Linux, but if you adapt the steps
installing and starting stuff it should work on any other OS as well.

1. Install everything. Check if anything is already installed and if it is remove it from the command.

For mysql:
emerge mysql mysql-python pygtk -av
/etc/init.d/mysql start
rc-update add mysql default

For postgresql:
emerge postgresql pygresql pygtk 
/etc/init.d/postgresql start
rc-update add postgresql default


2. Manual configuration steps

emerge --config mysql
The --config step will ask you for the mysql root user - set this securely, we will create a seperate account for fpdb

3. Create a mysql user and a database
Now open a shell (aka command prompt aka DOS window):
Click Start, then Run. In the opening window type "cmd" (without the inverted commas) and then click OK. A windows with a black background should open.

Type (replacing yourPassword with the root password for MySQL you specified during installation):
mysql --user=root --password=yourPassword

It should say something like this:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4
Server version: 5.0.60-log Gentoo Linux mysql-5.0.60-r1

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> 


Now create the actual database. The default name is fpdb, I recommend you keep it. Type this:
CREATE DATABASE fpdb;

Next you need to create a user. I recommend you use the default fpdb. Type this (replacing newPassword with the password you want the fpdb user to have - this can, but for security shouldn't, be the same as the root mysql password):
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fpdb.* TO 'fpdb'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newPassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Copy the .conf file from this directory to ~/.fpdb/profiles/default.conf and edit it according to what you configured just now, in particular you will definitely have to put in the password you configured. I know this is insecure, will fix it before stable release.


4. Guided installation steps
Run the GUI as described in readme-user and click the menu database -> recreate tables

That's it! Now see readme-user.txt for usage instructions.
