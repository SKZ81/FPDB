These instructions are for Gentoo GNU/Linux, but if you adapt the steps
installing and starting stuff it should work on any other OS as well.

1. Install everything. Check if anything is already installed and if it is remove it from the command.

For mysql:
emerge mysql mysql-python pygtk -av
/etc/init.d/mysql start
rc-update add mysql default

For postgresql:
emerge postgresql pygresql pygtk 
/etc/init.d/postgresql start
rc-update add postgresql default


2. Manual configuration steps

emerge --config mysql
The --config step will ask you for the mysql root user - set this securely, we will create a seperate account for fpdb

Create a user and a database, the default names are fpdb but you can choose whatever you want to. I did this in webmin, but it will be added to the GUI as well. Then set permissions for that user to: Select | Insert | Update | Delete | Create | Drop

Copy the .conf file from this directory to ~/.fpdb/profiles/default.conf and edit it according to what you configured just now, in particular you will definitely have to put in the password you configured. YES, THIS IS INSECURE.

3. Guided installation steps
Run the GUI as described in readme-user and click the menu database -> recreate tables

That's it!
