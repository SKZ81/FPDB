These instructions are for any Ubuntu Linux, but except for the name of the package management software it should be identical on other Linux distributions.

Using the package manager (I think it's called synaptics) install the dependencies: mysql, python, mysql-python, pygtk
I don't use ubuntu but I'd imagine it will at some point prompt you for a MySQL root password enter one and when it's done installing everything open a shell/terminal and type this:
mysql --user=root --password=YourMysqlRootPassword
It should say something like this:

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4
Server version: 5.0.60-log Ubuntu Linux mysql-5.0.60-r1

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>

Now type this:
CREATE DATABASE fpdb;

Next you need to create a user. Type this (replacing newPassword with the password you want the fpdb user to have - this can, but for security shouldn't, be the same as the root mysql password):
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fpdb.* TO 'fpdb'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newPassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Then download one of the alpha2 archives from the sourceforge page at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fpdb/ and unpack it into a folder of your choice.

Next create a directory called .fpdb (the . at the beginning is important) in your home directory, e.g. /home/steffen/.fpdb
Then copy the default.conf file from the docs directory of the archive into this new folder.
Finally edit default.conf with any texteditor and enter the fpdb password you entered above (in the GRANT ALL... command).

This should be it, try double clicking pyfpdb/fpdb.py or open it from a shell with python /path/to/fpdb/pyfpdb/fpdb.py

Now see readme-user.txt for usage instructions.
