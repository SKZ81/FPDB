todolist (db=database, imp=importer, tv=tableviewer)

before beta
===========
current speedup attempt todo:
holdem in fpdb_simple done - now update remaining files, test, then add back postflop and stud functionality

import fails on stud/razz
tv doesnt display street 3-5 in stud/razz i think
Any comment or print with "todo" in it in the sourcecode except what is marked todo in the menu
find out if i can SQL for the rowcount, rather than select a field and then just take the rowcount. this might bring a significant performance improvement
make a quick benchmark of mysql and postgresql: import of my whole db, some tableviewer refreshes with and without updated file
fix tv browse button size
tourney bug: sometimes truncuates position on store -> possibly indicates much bigger problem
tourney bug: fails recognisePlayer
tourney bug: fails with tuple error in recogniseplayerid
verify at least 2 or 3 sng hands
db+imp+tv WtSD (went to showdown)
db+imp+tv W$SD (won $ when seeing showdown - partial win counts partially here)
db+imp+tv WwSF (Won when seen flop - partial taken into account)
db+imp+tv steal blind from btn, co, lmp. fold SB/BB/BI to steal 
remove unused flags fields
update install instructions
setup wizard
change action_no to be total for this street rather than just for one player
catch index error, type error, file not found error
add field for if a game was mixed
implement error file in importer
Make tab and enter work as sensible in GUIs and implement Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+X and Alt+F4 for close.
use profile file for bulk import and table viewer settings and pathes
fold% also counts rounds where nobody raised
handle errors properly, in particular wrt to SQL rollback.
remove mysql/myisam support.
check that we read sitout correctly in: Full Tilt Poker Game #6150325318: Table Bogside
setup database, database-user and permission from GUI.
update prepare-git to check for license header and copyright.

change/expand print_hand to cover everything new and update verified hands' .found file

no rush but before 1.0RC
========================
make tv work with ftp e.g. by making importer return site as well (easy)
make the gui display errors
log file
move directory import code from gui to backend
convert fpdb_import to not require passing "self"
(tedious general stability improvement for unusual playernames): change all the str.find so they dont accidentially count player names containing the searched phrase. e.g. with rfind.
Doesn't handle Daylight Saving Time (I don't think at least)
Need to store if someone goes all-in, particularly for better NL/PL support.
verify at least 3 hands per category per site per limit_type (when cap then do 2 normal and one 1 capped) incl tv display
put lines in tv to make it easier to read
speed up so that refresh takes no more than 10 seks on my P3M-800
select range of stakes and sng/mtt values and types for tv
change "for i" to more sensible var name instead of i
change stud street storage from 3-7 to 0-4 throughout
in all importer: stop doing if site=="ftp", make class constants for site_id instead
recognise somewhere if a file is still active and if so keep it open and only read new hands rather than detecting dupes
gentoo ebuild
separate all gui and all processing into files that are named accordingly
ensure that there is only one db handle flying around and that its state is handled properly, ie. by the GUI. i think that might be why we have to reconnect the DB in tableviewer.
why do we have to reconnect in tv.read_names_clicked?
HUD for PokerStars
HTMLify docs

can wait till 1.x
=================
finish cleaning tabledesign html code
It treats fold due to disconnect as voluntary fold which is not ideal
auto-import
check for unnecessary db.commit()
aliases
Probably PartyPoker for all or most supported games
repair hands where the seat lines are missing, happens when observing at FTP
flags for storing the reason for winning (best hi, tie for best low, etc.) to DB. not sure actually if this is such a good idea remember that there can be multiple reasons for the same player in the same hand
windows integrated installer
benchmark properly on mysql innodb, mysql myisam, postgresql, sqlite, more?
rename things like this: ClassName.methodName and variableName. do this on tables too. update codingstyle
CLI (not ncurses, proper CLI) equivalent for fpdb.py
optimise/simplify storing by creating the SQL statements depending on hand rather than calling different methods
