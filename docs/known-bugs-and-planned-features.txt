todolist (db=database, imp=importer, tv=tableviewer)
Everything is subject to change and especially the order will often change. Patches for any of these or other features are very welcome, see readme-overview.txt for contacts.

alpha2 (release by 17Aug)
======
finish Cache generalisation from line 1814 onwards
add sf.net logo to webpage
change tabledesign VALIGN
seperate and improve instructions for update
split install instructions into OS-specific and OS-independent section. expand release creator to concatenate.
expand instructions for profile file, again, the release-creator will cat it.
add instructions for mailing list to contacts
finish updating filelist
ebuild: symlink doesnt work, USE gtk, more automation, update install-in-gentoo.txt, set permissions in it, copy docs to correct place, use games eclass or whatever to get games group notice, print notice about install-in-gentoo.txt and mysql --config
add minimal instructions for developing to git-instructions

alpha3
======
make sure totalProfit shows actual profit rather than winnings.
update abbreviations.txt
(steffen) finish bringing back tourney
store raw hand in db
export settings[hud-defaultInterval] to conf
fix up bg colours in tv
fill the fold to CB/2B/3B cache fields
verify the totalProfit cache field
fill the check-/call-raise cache fields
move version into seperate file for fpdb gui and db
anonymiser script to generate testdata without making a dozen find&replace all... remember to replace hand no with running no
table with data for graphs for SD/F, W$wSF, W$@SD
SD/F, W$wsF, W$@SD too low as reported by daedal in 2+2 forum on 12/13aug
show database version error in GUI and use fpdb_db class const for it, add it to title
split hud data generation into separate for loops and make it more efficient
fix bug that sawFlop/Turn/River gets miscalculated if someone is allin - might as well add all-in recognition for this

verify positionalness of HudData
printhand each and the 2/3 relevant printplayerflags respectively on ps-lhe-ring-successful-steal-by-cutoff.txt and ps-lhe-ring-call-3B-preflop-cb-no2b.txt

before beta
===========
maybe remove siteId from gametypes
?change most cache fields to bigint to allow extremely big databases in excess of 2 or 4 million hands per stake and position?
rakeback/frequent player points
gentoo ebuild: USE postgresql
skins
optionally combine FB/FS and CB/2B/3B 
separate all gui and all processing into files that are named accordingly
ensure that there is only one db handle flying around and that its state is handled properly, ie. by the GUI. i think that might be why we have to reconnect the DB in tableviewer.
figure out what slowed it down so much between git19 and git21 (8/9aug)
why do we have to reconnect in tv.read_names_clicked?
implement error file in importer
catch index error, type error, file not found error
use different colours according to classification.

add stud, razz and tourney back to imp/tv but with less seperate codepathes
move prepare-git.sh and create-release.sh to utils
offer not storing db password
change definition of bet to exclude bring in?
in tv, select from hud table using named fields rather than the current *
remove remains of mysql/myisam support.
tourney bug: sometimes truncuates position on store -> possibly indicates much bigger problem
tourney bug: fails recognisePlayer
tourney bug: fails with tuple error in recogniseplayerid
fix GUI's load profile
HUD
config wizard
file permission script, use games group
change stud street storage from 3-7 to 0-4 throughout (possibly best way is to just shrink the holding array in fpdb_simple.createArrays
make bulk importer display a grand total in the GUI
change save_to_db into one method and probably move into parse_logic
Any comment or print with "todo" in it in the sourcecode except what is marked todo in the menu
make a quick benchmark of mysql and postgresql: import of my whole db, some tableviewer refreshes with and without updated file
Make tab and enter work as sensible in GUIs and implement Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+X and Alt+F4 for close.
use profile file for bulk import and table viewer settings and pathes
handle errors properly, in particular wrt to SQL rollback.
check that we read sitout correctly in: Full Tilt Poker Game #6150325318: Table Bogside
setup database, database-user and permission from GUI.
update prepare-git to check for license header and copyright.
verify at least 2 or 3 sng hands

no rush but before 1.0RC
========================
recognise&handle all-in for CB etc. (mostly useful for NL/PL, in limit I would argue missing a chance due to lack of money is the same as missing it due to sneezing and clicking the wrong button)
In many places there are unnecessary database accesses or it regenerates information it already had before or just generally does things in obscenely inefficient ways. Optimise this
multi-select in bulk importer
make option to use "traditional" labels, e.g. WtSD instead of SD/F
HTMLify docs and validate them
cut down action_types array size to appropriate length
make the gui display errors
log file
move directory import code from gui to backend
convert fpdb_import to not require passing "self", generally clean the parameter passing
(tedious general stability improvement for unusual playernames): change all the str.find so they dont accidentially count player names containing the searched phrase. e.g. with rfind.
Doesn't handle Daylight Saving Time (I don't think at least)
Need to store if someone goes all-in, particularly for better NL/PL support.
verify at least 3 hands per category per site per limit_type (when cap then do 2 normal and one 1 capped) incl tv display
put lines in tv to make it easier to read
ensure that refresh still takes no more than 10 seks on my P3M-800 (a quick run on git15 indicates this is ok now), or 5 with remote DB
select range of stakes and sng/mtt values and types for tv
change "for i" to more sensible var name instead of i
recognise somewhere if a file is still active and if so keep it open and only read new hands rather than detecting dupes

can wait till 1.x
=================
return full ftp functionality
in all importer: stop doing if site=="ftp", make class constants for site_id instead
finish cleaning tabledesign html code
rearrange huddata fields
It treats fold due to disconnect as voluntary fold which is not ideal
check for unnecessary db.commit()
aliases
Probably PartyPoker for all or most supported games
repair hands where the seat lines are missing, happens when observing at FTP
flags for storing the reason for winning (best hi, tie for best low, etc.) to DB. not sure actually if this is such a good idea remember that there can be multiple reasons for the same player in the same hand
windows integrated installer
benchmark properly on mysql innodb, postgresql, more?
rename things like this: ClassName.methodName and variableName. do this on tables too. update codingstyle
CLI (not ncurses, proper CLI) equivalent for fpdb.py
optimise/simplify storing by creating the SQL statements depending on hand rather than calling different methods
make range of activeSeats configurable for tv/hud
