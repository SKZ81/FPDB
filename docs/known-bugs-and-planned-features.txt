before beta
===========
change to savannah?



Any comment or print with "todo" in it in the sourcecode except what is marked todo in the menu
make a quick benchmark of mysql and postgresql: import of my whole db, some tableviewer refreshes with and without updated file
Make tab and enter work as sensible in GUIs and implement Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+X and Alt+F4 for close.
use profile file for bulk import and table viewer settings and pathes
check that we read sitout correctly in: Full Tilt Poker Game #6150325318: Table Bogside
verify at least 2 or 3 sng hands

no rush but before 1.0RC
========================
improve handling of dead hand before BB, see git101/7bd1631
make DB version error offer reimport, recreation and  continue.
In many places there are unnecessary database accesses or it regenerates information it already had before or just generally does things in obscenely inefficient ways. Optimise this
multi-select in bulk importer
cut down action_types array size to appropriate length
make the gui display errors
log file
move directory import code from gui to backend
convert fpdb_import to not require passing "self", generally clean the parameter passing
Doesn't handle Daylight Saving Time (I don't think at least)
ensure that refresh still takes no more than 10 seks on my P3M-800 (a quick run on git15 indicates this is ok now), or 5 with remote DB
select range of stakes and sng/mtt values and types for hud
recognise somewhere if a file is still active and if so keep it open and only read new hands rather than detecting dupes
return full ftp functionality

can wait till 1.x
=================
in all importer: stop doing if site=="ftp", make class constants for site_id instead
It treats fold due to disconnect as voluntary fold which is not ideal
aliases
repair hands where the seat lines are missing, happens when observing at FTP
flags for storing the reason for winning (best hi, tie for best low, etc.) to DB. not sure actually if this is such a good idea remember that there can be multiple reasons for the same player in the same hand
benchmark properly on mysql innodb, postgresql, more?
rename things like this: ClassName.methodName and variableName. update codingstyle
CLI (not ncurses, normal CLI) equivalent for fpdb.py
optimise/simplify storing by creating the SQL statements depending on hand rather than calling different methods
make range of activeSeats configurable for tv/hud
