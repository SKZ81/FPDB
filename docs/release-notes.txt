alpha2
======
Hi everyone,
we are proud to announce the second alpha release of fpdb, the free/libre open source poker tracker. The biggest highlight is the HUD for Linux made by Ray (and perhaps Mac, not sure). But for everyone fpdb now also supports PS tournaments (SnG and MTT) and FTP ring games. There is also a new auto-importer though it currently only runs on one file per instance (but you can open multiple instances of fpdb).
Fpdb also parses alot of new situations into the cache table for the HUD, most of which are already available through the Linux HUD. There have also been a large number of bugfixes for all kinds of things. For full details of the changes see the git commit comments.

You can download fpdb at https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=226872

Our website at http://fpdb.sourceforge.net/ will be updated shortly but in the meantime please note that the configuration file now resides in ~/.fpdb/default.conf on Linux/Mac and in C:\Documents and Settings\Application Data\fpdb\default.conf on Windows (on non-English Windows you have to translate the Documents and Settings, but not the Application data bit). Apart from that just follow the instructions on the site. I will be updating/improving the fpdb ebuild for Gentoo next week, please send me a PM or email if you would like a package for another Linux/BSD.

To use the HUD in Linux simply run the auto importer whilst having the table open. You will also have to rename HUD_config.xml.example to HUD_config.xml and edit the database parameters in there in addition to what is written in the install guide.

If you've been using fpdb alpha1 just delete the fpdb folder, follow the installation guide except for installing the dependencies, then run fpdb and run recreate tables. Note that you will have to reimport ALL your history files.

For external devs (in particular Youre Toast): The table design has gone through some changes, though most of it was just renaming to make a consistent naming scheme and to make it more flexible towards stud/razz type games. I do not expect to having to make any future changes to the existing fields but I cannot yet guarantee that. There will be some additional fields in particular in the HudCache table. Please let me know if you need any further fields. I realise my naming breaks the "database designer's convention" but for this project I feel ignoring this convention for the benefit of consistent naming between Python and SQL is ok.


Any questions and comments please post here, send me a PM or email, post a feature request or bug report on sourceforge or use any of the other means of contact listed on our webpage.

Enjoy,
The fpdb team

PS: I personally will be away Sun-Tue so I probably won't be responding to anything but feel free to message me anyways, but if you post here or at SF someone else might be able to help.

alpha1
======
Hi everyone,
I am proud to announce the first release of my new poker tracking software fpdb (freepokerdb, very imaginative I know ;) ). You may wonder why I bothered when now with HM and PT3 there are at least two excellent packages to choose from.

Four main reasons:
1. Fpdb is free/libre open source software. In short, this means you don't depend on me if sth. is wrong or you want something more in this program as you can freely change it yourself. You also don't have to pay anything for it. If you like it and think I deserve to be paid just drop me a mail ;)
2. HM and PT3 only support holdem. Fpdb initially supports Holdem and Omaha, with Stud and Razz mostly implemented and coming soon.
3. HM and PT3 run on Windows only, and for me at least did not work in wine even after installing Mono. Fpdb runs on any plattform that has the required software, which will cover roundabout 99.9% of PCs. Currently tested plattforms are Windows XP-x86 and Gentoo GNU/Linux-amd64 as well as -x86.
	You still need to run Windows or wine to run the actual poker client though.
4. Fpdb won't irritate you with copy prevention measures.

To install it go to https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=226872 and download the zip or tar.bz2, unpack it, and follow the instructions in docs/install-in-* for your operating system (e.g. docs\install-in-windows.txt). Sourceforge lists the release files as source files, not as binary executables - this is correct, python will automagically compile as and when required.

This is alpha1, as the name indicates it is still at a very early stage. The importer and database are nearing completion but the GUI in particular is not very functional yet and the HUD is missing alltogether. 

If anyone wishes to help with development that would be very very welcome and I've put a few notes in docs/readme-dev.txt in the download for what you could do. Or just start coding and send me the patches :)
If you're not a programmer and you're not interested in learning it you can still help simply by trying it out and sending bug reports and feature requests. To avoid unrealistic expectations I'd like to state that it'll be a long time until fpdb reaches feature parity to established paid-for closed source software.

Feature List (short now, growing fast ;) ):

You can edit/add whatever you like, it's all python and SQL. The code should be fairly straightforward I think and I put some notes into readme-dev.txt but feel free to ask.

Backend, Distribution
=====================
- Choice of MySQL/InnoDB or PostgreSQL. (not tested on PostgreSQL)
- It is possible to run the database on one PC, the importer on another, and then access the database with the table viewer or HUD from a third PC. (note: do NOT do this unencrypted over an untrusted network like your employer's LAN or the Internet!)

Site/Game Support
=================
- Initially only full support for PS, FTP coming soon
- Supports Holdem, Omaha Hi and Omaha Hi/Lo. Stud and Razz coming soon.
- Supports No Limit, Pot Limit, Fixed Limit NL, Cap NL and Cap PL
	Note that currently it does not display extra stats for NL/PL so usefulness is limited for these limit types. Suggestions welcome, I don't play these.
- Supports ring/cash games, SnG/MTT coming soon

Tableviewer (tv)
===========
Tv takes a history filename and loads the appropriate players' stats and displays them in a tabular format. These stats currently are:
	- VPIP, PFR and Preflop 3B/4B (3B/4B is not quite correct I think)
	- Raise and Fold % on flop, turn and river. Fold only counts hands when someone raised. This can be displayed per street or as one combined value each for aggression and folding.
	- Number of hands this is based on.
	- SD/F (aka WtSD, proportion of hands where player went to showdown after seeing flop)
	- W$wSF (Won $ when seen Flop)
	- W$@SD (Won $ at showdown)
	For all stats it also displays how many hands this particular is based on
		

IMPORTANT: The database format WILL undergo more changes and at this point I am not planning to write a converter so please keep your history files so you can re-import when necessary. Independent of this you should always keep the original raw files in a safe place with any tracking software. Should you however end up loosing your files somehow let me know and I'll try to help.

Please send any feedback, feature requests/suggestions, bug reports and animal names to steffen@sycamoretest.info, pick one of the contact methods listed in readme-overview.txt, send me a PM here or reply to this post.
